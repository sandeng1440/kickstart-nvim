-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--  To update plugins, you can run
--    :Lazy update
require('lazy').setup {
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
  -- with the first argument being the link and the following
  -- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
  -- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
  --  This is equivalent to:
  --    require('Comment').setup({})
  --
  -- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
  -- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
  -- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
  -- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  --  event = 'VimEnter'
  -- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
  -- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
  -- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
  -- after the plugin has been loaded:
  --  config = function() ... end
  --
  -- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for kickstart
  --  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).

  -- require 'sandeng.plugins.debug',
  -- require 'sandeng.plugins.indent_line',
  { import = 'sandeng.plugins' },
